Implement a function that takes two strings, s and x, as arguments and finds the first occurrence of the string x in s. The function should return an integer indicating the index in s of the first occurrence of x. If there are no occurrences of x in s, return -1.

Example

For s = "CodefightsIsAwesome" and x = "IA", the output should be
strstr(s, x) = -1;
For s = "CodefightsIsAwesome" and x = "IsA", the output should be
strstr(s, x) = 10.
*/

function strstr(s, x) {
    return s.indexOf(x);
}
